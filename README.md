# LDL - Learning Deep Learning

## Summary
LDL is a neural-network framework that makes it easier to create a neural
network from scratch. By allowing data scientists to override important functions,
LDL makes it easier to code the neural network. Through this method, an entire
neural network can be coded from scratch, one piece at a time. Furthermore, each
individual component can automatically be incorporated into a working network,
without the need to have everything ready at once.
