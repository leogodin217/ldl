# LDL - Learning Deep Learning

## Summary
LDL is a neural-network framework that makes it easier to create a neural
network from scratch. By allowing data scientists to override important functions,
LDL makes it easier to code the neural network. Through this method, an entire
neural network can be coded from scratch, one piece at a time. Furthermore, each
individual component can automatically be incorporated into a working network,
without the need to have everything ready at once.

LDL is well documented in the style of Read the Docs. To learn how to use LDL
read documentation [here.](https://leogodin217.github.io/ldl/)

Three Juypter notebooks are provided in the github repository to show examples
of using LDL.

**Network Training** - Shows how to compare different learning rates using the default
settings to classify the MNIST dataset.

**Network Size** - Shows how to compare different architectures using the default
settings to classify the MNIST dataset.

**From Scratch** - Shows how to implement your own functions for activation and cost.

This README, covers the analysis of the network on the MNIST dataset.

## Exploratory Analysis

### Weights and Biases


### Architecture
First, we want to see what architecture works best
